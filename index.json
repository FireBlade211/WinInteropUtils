This flag overrides the setting of the EOAC_DISABLE_AAA flag from the EOLE_AUTHENTICATION_CAPABILITIES enumeration. This flag cannot be set at the same time as EnableActivateAsActivator. Any activation where a server process would be launched under the caller's identity is known as an activate-as-activator (AAA) activation. Disabling AAA activations allows an application that runs under a privileged account (such as LocalSystem) to help prevent its identity from being used to launch untrusted components. Library applications that use activation calls should always set this flag during those calls. This helps prevent the library application from being used in an escalation-of-privilege security attack.

(CLSCTX_RESERVED6) Remarks Values from the COM.CreateInstanceContext enumeration are used in activation calls (CreateInstance<TCoInterface>(Guid, IUnknown?, CreateInstanceContext, Guid, out TCoInterface?), CoCreateInstanceEx, CoGetClassObject, and so on) to indicate the preferred execution contexts (in-process, local, or remote) in which an object is to be run. They are also used in calls to CoRegisterClassObject to indicate the set of execution contexts in which a class object is to be made available for requests to construct instances. To indicate that more than one context is acceptable, you can combine multiple values with Boolean ORs. The contexts are tried in the order in which they are listed. Given a set of COM.CreateInstanceContext flags, the execution context to be used depends on the availability of registered class codes and other parameters according to the following algorithm. If the call specifies one of the following, RemoteServer is implied and is added to the list of flags: An explicit COSERVERINFO structure indicating a machine different from the current computer. No explicit COSERVERINFO structure specified but the specified class is registered with either the RemoteServerName or ActivateAtStorage registry value. The second case allows applications written prior to the release of distributed COM to be the configuration of classes for remote activation to be used by client applications available prior to DCOM and the RemoteServer flag. The cases in which there would be no explicit COSERVERINFO structure are when the value is specified as null or when it is not one of the function parameters (as in calls to CreateInstance<TCoInterface>(Guid, IUnknown?, CreateInstanceContext, Guid, out TCoInterface?) and CoGetClassObject). If the explicit COSERVERINFO parameter indicates the current computer, RemoteServer is removed if present. The rest of the processing proceeds by looking at the value(s) in the following sequence: If the flags include RemoteServer and no COSERVERINFO parameter is specified and if the activation request indicates a persistent state from which to initialize the object (with CoGetInstanceFromFile, CoGetInstanceFromIStorage, or, for a file moniker, in a call to IMoniker::BindToObject) and the class has an ActivateAtStorage subkey or no class registry information whatsoever, the request to activate and initialize is forwarded to the computer where the persistent state resides. (Refer to the remote activation functions listed in the See Also section for details.) If the flags include InprocServer, the class code in the DLL found under the class's InprocServer32 key is used if this key exists. The class code will run within the same process as the caller. If the flags include InprocHandler, the class code in the DLL found under the class's InprocHandler32 key is used if this key exists. The class code will run within the same process as the caller. If the flags include LocalServer, the class code in the service found under the class's LocalService key is used if this key exists. If no service is specified but an EXE is specified under that same key, the class code associated with that EXE is used. The class code (in either case) will be run in a separate service process on the same computer as the caller. If the flag is set to RemoteServer and an additional COSERVERINFO parameter to the function specifies a particular remote computer, a request to activate is forwarded to this remote computer with flags modified to set to LocalServer. The class code will run in its own process on this specific computer, which must be different from that of the caller. Finally, if the flags include RemoteServer and no COSERVERINFO parameter is specified and if a computer name is given under the class's RemoteServerName named-value, the request to activate is forwarded to this remote computer with the flags modified to be set to LocalServer. The class code will run in its own process on this specific computer, which must be different from that of the caller. Activate32BitServer and Activate64BitServer The 64-bit versions of Windows introduce two new flags: Activate32BitServer and Activate64BitServer. On a 64-bit computer, a 32-bit and 64-bit version of the same COM server may coexist. When a client requests an activation of an out-of-process server, these COM.CreateInstanceContext flags allow the client to specify a 32-bit or a 64-bit version of the server. Usually, a client will not care whether it uses a 32-bit or a 64-bit version of the server. However, if the server itself loads an additional in-process server, then it and the in-process server must both be either 32-bit or 64-bit. For example, suppose that the client wants to use a server \"A\", which in turn loads an in-process server \"B\". If only a 32-bit version of server \"B\" is available, then the client must specify the 32-bit version of server \"A\". If only a 64-bit version of server \"B\" is available, then the client must specify the 64-bit version of server \"A\". A server can specify its own architecture preference via the PreferredServerBitness registry key, but the client's preference, specified via a Activate32BitServer or Activate64BitServer flag, will override the server's preference. If the client does not specify a preference, then the server's preference will be used. If neither the client nor the server specifies a preference, then: If the computer that hosts the server is running Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) or a later system, then COM will try to match the server architecture to the client architecture. In other words, for a 32-bit client, COM will activate a 32-bit server if available; otherwise it will activate a 64-bit version of the server. For a 64-bit client, COM will activate a 64-bit server if available; otherwise it will activate a 32-bit server. If the computer that hosts the server is running Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 without SP1 or later installed, then COM will prefer a 64-bit version of the server if available; otherwise it will activate a 32-bit version of the server. If a COM.CreateInstanceContext enumeration has both the Activate32BitServer and Activate64BitServer flags set, then it is invalid and the activation will return E_INVALIDARG. The flags Activate32BitServer and Activate64BitServer flow across computer boundaries. If the computer that hosts the server is running the 64-bit Windows, then it will honor these flags; otherwise it will ignore them."

    "summary": "Class COM Namespace FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.ComponentObjectModel Assembly WinInteropUtils.dll Provides basic COM (Component-Object Model) methods from Ole32.dll required to use COM. public static class COM Inheritance object COM Inherited Members object.Equals(object) object.Equals(object, object) object.GetHashCode() object.GetType() object.MemberwiseClone() object.ReferenceEquals(object, object) object.ToString() Methods CreateInstance<TCoInterface>(Guid, IUnknown?, CreateInstanceContext, Guid, out TCoInterface?) Creates and default-initializes a single object of the class associated with a specified CLSID. Call CoCreateInstance when you want to create only one object on the local system. To create a single object on a remote system, call the CoCreateInstanceEx function. To create multiple objects based on a single CLSID, call the CoGetClassObject function. public static HRESULT CreateInstance<TCoInterface>(Guid rclsid, IUnknown? pUnkOuter, COM.CreateInstanceContext dwClsContext, Guid riid, out TCoInterface? ppv) where TCoInterface : IUnknown Parameters rclsid Guid The CLSID associated with the data and code that will be used to create the object. pUnkOuter IUnknown If null, indicates that the object is not being created as part of an aggregate. If non-null, pointer to the aggregate object's IUnknown interface (the controlling IUnknown). dwClsContext COM.CreateInstanceContext Context in which the code that manages the newly created object will run. A bitwise combination of COM.CreateInstanceContext values. riid Guid A reference to the identifier of the interface to be used to communicate with the object. ppv TCoInterface Upon successful return, ppv contains the requested interface. Upon failure, ppv contains null. Returns HRESULT A HRESULT. It can be one of the following values: S_OK An instance of the specified object class was successfully created. REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG A specified class is not registered in the registration database. Also can indicate that the type of server you requested in the COM.CreateInstanceContext enumeration is not registered or the values for the server types in the registry are corrupt. CLASS_E_NOAGGREGATION This class cannot be created as part of an aggregate. E_NOINTERFACE The specified class does not implement the requested interface, or the controlling IUnknown does not expose the requested interface. E_POINTER The ppv parameter is null. Type Parameters TCoInterface Remarks The CreateInstance<TCoInterface>(Guid, IUnknown?, CreateInstanceContext, Guid, out TCoInterface?) function provides a convenient shortcut by connecting to the class object associated with the specified CLSID, creating a default-initialized instance, and releasing the class object. It is convenient to use CreateInstance<TCoInterface>(Guid, IUnknown?, CreateInstanceContext, Guid, out TCoInterface?) when you need to create only a single instance of an object on the local machine. If you are creating an instance on remote computer, call CoCreateInstanceEx. In the COM.CreateInstanceContext enumeration, you can specify the type of server used to manage the object. The constants can be InprocServer, InprocHandler, LocalServer, RemoteServer or any combination of these values. UWP applications Although there are no restrictions on which CLSIDs a UWP application can pass to CreateInstance<TCoInterface>(Guid, IUnknown?, CreateInstanceContext, Guid, out TCoInterface?), many objects will fail with E_ACCESSDENIED for security reasons, especially if they do not run in-process. Additionally, even if you can successfully create an object, it might fail at a later time due to UWP security constraints, app-model differences, etc. In particular, background tasks should limit the objects they communicate with to avoid hangs or other complications due to connected stand-by. Exceptions InvalidOperationException TCoInterface must be an interface. Initialize() Initializes the COM library on the current thread and identifies the concurrency model as single-thread apartment (STA). public static HRESULT Initialize() Returns HRESULT This function can return the standard return values E_INVALIDARG, E_OUTOFMEMORY, and E_UNEXPECTED, as well as the following values: S_OK The COM library was initialized successfully on this thread. S_FALSE The COM library is already initialized on this thread. RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE A previous call to Initialize(COMInitOptions) specified the concurrency model for this thread as multithread apartment (MTA). This could also indicate that a change from neutral-threaded apartment to single-threaded apartment has occurred. Remarks New applications should call Initialize(COMInitOptions) instead of Initialize(). If you want to use the Windows Runtime, you must call RoInitialize or Windows::Foundation::Initialize instead. Initialize(COMInitOptions) Initializes the COM library for use by the calling thread, sets the thread's concurrency model, and creates a new apartment for the thread if one is required. public static HRESULT Initialize(COM.COMInitOptions options) Parameters options COM.COMInitOptions The concurrency model and initialization options for the thread. Any combination of values from COM.COMInitOptions can be used, except that the ApartmentThreaded and MultiThreaded flags cannot both be set. The default is MultiThreaded. Returns HRESULT This function can return either S_OK or S_FALSE. Remarks Initialize(COMInitOptions) must be called at least once, and is usually called only once, for each thread that uses the COM library. Multiple calls to Initialize(COMInitOptions) by the same thread are allowed as long as they pass the same concurrency flag, but subsequent valid calls return S_FALSE. If the concurrency flag does not match, then the call fails and returns RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE. (For the purpose of this rule, a call to CoInitialize is equivalent to calling Initialize(COMInitOptions) with the ApartmentThreaded flag.) To uninitialize the COM library gracefully on a thread, each successful call to CoInitialize or Initialize(COMInitOptions), including any call that returns S_FALSE, must be balanced by a corresponding call to Uninitialize(). Once COM has been uninitialized on a thread, you can reinitialize it in any mode, subject to the constraints above. You need to initialize the COM library on a thread before you call any of the library functions except CoGetMalloc, to get a pointer to the standard allocator, and the memory allocation functions. Otherwise, the COM function will return CO_E_NOTINITIALIZED. Objects created in a single-threaded apartment (STA) receive method calls only from their apartment's thread, so calls are serialized and arrive only at message-queue boundaries (when the PeekMessage or SendMessage function is called). Objects created on a COM thread in a multithread apartment (MTA) must be able to receive method calls from other threads at any time. You would typically implement some form of concurrency control in a multithreaded object's code using synchronization primitives such as critical sections, semaphores, or mutexes to help protect the object's data. When an object that is configured to run in the neutral threaded apartment (NTA) is called by a thread that is in either an STA or the MTA, that thread transfers to the NTA. If this thread subsequently calls Initialize(COMInitOptions), the call fails and returns RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE. Because OLE technologies are not thread-safe, the OleInitialize function calls Initialize(COMInitOptions) with the ApartmentThreaded flag. As a result, an apartment that is initialized for multithreaded object concurrency cannot use the features enabled by OleInitialize. Because there is no way to control the order in which in-process servers are loaded or unloaded, do not call CoInitialize, Initialize(COMInitOptions), or Uninitialize() from the DllMain function. Uninitialize() Closes the COM library on the current thread, unloads all DLLs loaded by the thread, frees any other resources that the thread maintains, and forces all RPC connections on the thread to close. public static extern void Uninitialize() Remarks A thread must call Uninitialize() once for each successful call it has made to the Initialize(COMInitOptions) function, including any call that returns S_FALSE. Only the Uninitialize() call corresponding to the Initialize(COMInitOptions) call that initialized the library can close it. Calls to OleInitialize must be balanced by calls to OleUninitialize. The OleUninitialize function calls Uninitialize() internally, so applications that call OleUninitialize do not also need to call Uninitialize(). Uninitialize() should be called on application shutdown, as the last call made to the COM library after the application hides its main windows and falls through its main message loop. If there are open conversations remaining, Uninitialize() starts a modal message loop and dispatches any pending messages from the containers or server for this COM application. By dispatching the messages, Uninitialize() ensures that the application does not quit before receiving all of its pending messages. Non-COM messages are discarded. Because there is no way to control the order in which in-process servers are loaded or unloaded, do not call CoInitialize, Initialize(COMInitOptions), or Uninitialize() from the DllMain function."

When the client is finished with the dialog, that client must call the Unadvise(uint) method with this value. Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. Close(HRESULT) Closes the dialog. HRESULT Close(HRESULT hr) Parameters hr HRESULT The code that will be returned by Show(nint) to indicate that the dialog was closed before a selection was made. Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. Remarks An application can call this method from a callback method or function while the dialog is open. The dialog will close and the Show(nint) method will return with the HRESULT specified in hr.

Remarks GetFileTypeIndex(out uint) can be called either while the dialog is open or after it has closed. Note: The index returned by this function is a one-based index rather than zero-based. GetFolder(out nint) Gets either the folder currently selected in the dialog, or, if the dialog is not currently displayed, the folder that is to be selected when the dialog is opened. HRESULT GetFolder(out nint ppsi) Parameters ppsi nint The address of a pointer to the IShellItem interface that represents the folder. Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. Remarks The calling application is responsible for releasing the retrieved IShellItem when it is no longer needed. GetOptions(out uint) Gets the current flags that are set to control dialog behavior. HRESULT GetOptions(out uint pfos) Parameters pfos uint When this method returns successfully, points to a value made up of one or more of the FILEOPENDIALOGOPTIONS values. Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. GetResult(out nint) Gets the choice that the user made in the dialog. HRESULT GetResult(out nint ppsi) Parameters ppsi nint The address of a pointer to an IShellItem that represents the user's choice. Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. Remarks GetResult(out nint) can be called after the dialog has closed or during the handling of an OnFileOk event. Calling this method at any other time will fail. If multiple items were chosen, this method will fail. In the case of multiple items, call GetResults(out nint). Show(nint) must return a success code for a result to be available to GetResult(out nint). SetDefaultFolder(nint) Sets the folder used as a default if there is not a recently used folder value available. HRESULT SetDefaultFolder(nint psi) Parameters psi nint A pointer to the IShellItem interface that represents the folder. Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. SetFileName(string) Sets the file name that appears in the File name edit box when that dialog box is opened. HRESULT SetFileName(string pszName) Parameters pszName string A pointer to the name of the file. Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. SetFileTypeIndex(uint) Sets the file type that appears as selected in the dialog. HRESULT SetFileTypeIndex(uint iFileType) Parameters iFileType uint The index of the file type in the file type array passed to SetFileTypes(uint, nint) in its cFileTypes parameter. Note that this is a one-based index, not zero-based. Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. SetFileTypes(uint, nint) Sets the file types that the dialog can open or save. HRESULT SetFileTypes(uint cFileTypes, nint rgFilterSpec) Parameters cFileTypes uint The number of elements in the array specified by rgFilterSpec. rgFilterSpec nint A pointer to an array of COMDLG_FILTERSPEC structures, each representing a file type. Returns HRESULT If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code, including the following: E_UNEXPECTED SetFileTypes(uint, nint) has already been called. E_UNEXPECTED The FOS_PICKFOLDERS flag was set in the SetOptions(uint) method. E_INVALIDARG The rgFilterSpec parameter is null. Examples The following code example demonstrates the use of the array of COMDLG_FILTERSPEC structures in the context of this method. The example array consists of three COMDLG_FILTERSPEC structures. The first declares two patterns for the dialog filter, the second declares a single pattern, and the last shows files of all types. The variables szJPG, szBMP, and szAll are assumed to be previously declared strings that provide a friendly name for each filter. Warning: This is C++ code, as the COMDLG_FILTERSPEC struct hasn't yet been ported to WinInteropUtils. COMDLG_FILTERSPEC rgSpec[] = { { szJPG, L\".jpg;.jpeg\" }, { szBMP, L\".bmp\" }, { szAll, L\".*\" }, }; Remarks When using the Open dialog, the file types declared there are used to filter the view. When using the Save dialog, these values determine which file name extension is appended to the file name. This method must be called before the dialog is shown and can only be called once for each dialog instance. File types cannot be modified once the Common Item dialog box is displayed. SetFilter(nint) Sets the filter. Deprecated since Windows 7. HRESULT SetFilter(nint pFilter) Parameters pFilter nint A pointer to the IShellItemFilter that is to be set. Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. Remarks This method can be used if the application needs to perform special filtering to remove some items from the dialog box's view. IncludeItem will be called for each item that would normally be included in the view. GetEnumFlagsForItem is not used. To filter by file type, SetFileTypes(uint, nint) should be used, because in folders with a large number of items it may offer better performance than applying an IShellItemFilter. This method is obsolete since Windows 7. Do not use it in new projects. SetFolder(nint) Sets a folder that is always selected when the dialog is opened, regardless of previous user action. HRESULT SetFolder(nint psi) Parameters psi nint A pointer to the IShellItem interface that represents the folder. Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. Remarks This folder overrides any \"most recently used\" folder. If this method is called while the dialog is displayed, it causes the dialog to navigate to the specified folder. In general, we do not recommended the use of this method. If you call SetFolder(nint) before you display the dialog box, the most recent location that the user saved to or opened from is not shown. Unless there is a very specific reason for this behavior, it is not a good or expected user experience and should therefore be avoided. In almost all instances, SetDefaultFolder(nint) is the better method. As of Windows 7, if the path of the folder specified through psi is the default path of a known folder, the known folder's current path is used in the dialog. That path might not be the same as the path specified in psi; for instance, if the known folder has been redirected. If the known folder is a library (virtual folders Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos), the library's path is used in the dialog. If the specified library is hidden (as they are by default as of Windows 8.1), the library's default save location is used in the dialog, such as the Microsoft OneDrive Documents folder for the Documents library. Because of these mappings, the folder location used in the dialog might not be exactly as you specified when you called this method. SetOptions(uint) Sets flags to control the behavior of the dialog. HRESULT SetOptions(uint fos) Parameters fos uint One or more of the FILEOPENDIALOGOPTIONS values. Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. Remarks Generally, this method should take the value that was retrieved by GetOptions(out uint) and modify it to include or exclude options by setting the appropriate flags. SetTitle(string) Sets the title of the dialog. HRESULT SetTitle(string pszTitle) Parameters pszTitle string A pointer to a string that contains the title text. Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. Unadvise(uint) Removes an event handler that was attached through the Advise(nint, out uint) method. HRESULT Unadvise(uint dwCookie) Parameters dwCookie uint The DWORD value that represents the event handler. This value is obtained through the pdwCookie parameter of the Advise(nint, out uint) method. Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code."

Their labels can also be changed at any time. Container controls are controls that can have items added to them. Container controls include combo boxes, menus, the drop-down list attached to the Open button, and any option button groups. The order that items appear in a container is the order in which they were added. There is no facility for reordering them. IDs are scoped to the parent control. Container controls, with the exception of menus, have a selected item. Items with a container control cannot be changed after they have been created, except for their enabled and visible states. However, they can be added and removed at any time. For example, if you needed to change the text of a menu, you would have to remove the current menu and add another with the correct text.

Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. Remarks To determine the user's final choice, this method can be called on option button groups, combo boxes, and drop-down lists on the Open or Save button after the dialog has closed. This method cannot be called on menus. For option button groups and combo boxes, this method can also be called while the dialog is showing, to determine the current choice. MakeProminent(uint) Places a control in the dialog so that it stands out compared to other added controls. HRESULT MakeProminent(uint dwIDCtl) Parameters dwIDCtl uint The ID of the control. Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. Remarks This method causes the control to be placed near the Open or Save button instead of being grouped with the rest of the custom controls. Only check buttons (check boxes), push buttons, combo boxes, and menus—or a visual group that contains only a single item of one of those types—can be made prominent. Only one control can be marked in this way. If a dialog has only one added control, that control is marked as prominent by default. RemoveControlItem(uint, uint) Removes an item from a container control in the dialog.

Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. Remarks This method can be called while the dialog is showing to retrieve the current set of values in the metadata collection pane. It can also be called after the dialog has closed, to retrieve the final set of values. The call to this method will fail unless property collection has been turned on with a call to SetCollectedProperties(nint, bool).

Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. Remarks The calling application can use the PSGetPropertyDescriptionListFromString function to construct an IPropertyDescriptionList from a string such as \"prop:Comments;Subject;\". For more information about property schemas, see Property Schemas. SetCollectedProperties(nint, bool) can be called at any time before the dialog is displayed or while it is visible. If different properties are to be collected depending on the chosen filetype, then SetCollectedProperties(nint, bool) can be called in response to OnTypeChange. Note: By default, no properties are collected in the save dialog. SetProperties(nint) Provides a property store that defines the default values to be used for the item being saved. HRESULT SetProperties(nint pStore) Parameters pStore nint Pointer to the IPropertyStore interface that represents the property store that contains the associated metadata. Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. Remarks This method can be called at any time before the dialog is opened or while the dialog is showing. If an item has inherent properties, this method should be called with those properties before showing the dialog. When using Save As, the application should provide the properties of the item being saved to the Save dialog. Those properties should be retreived from the original item by calling GetPropertyStore with the GPS_HANDLERPROPERTIESONLY flag. To retrieve the properties of the saved item (which may have been modified by the user) after the dialog closes, call GetProperties(out nint). To turn on property collection and indicate which properties should be displayed in the Save dialog, use SetCollectedProperties(nint, bool). SetSaveAsItem(nint) Sets an item to be used as the initial entry in a Save As dialog. HRESULT SetSaveAsItem(nint psi) Parameters psi nint Pointer to an IShellItem that represents the item. Returns HRESULT If this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. Remarks The name of the item is displayed in the file name edit box, and the containing folder is opened in the view.

    "summary": "Interface IUnknown Namespace FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.ComponentObjectModel.Interfaces Assembly WinInteropUtils.dll Enables clients to get pointers to other interfaces on a given object through the QueryInterface(ref Guid, out nint) method, and manage the existence of the object through the AddRef() and Release() methods. All other COM interfaces are inherited, directly or indirectly, from IUnknown. Therefore, the three methods in IUnknown are the first entries in the vtable for every interface. [InterfaceType(ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIUnknown)] [Guid(\"00000000-0000-0000-C000-000000000046\")] public interface IUnknown Methods AddRef() Increments the reference count for an interface pointer to a COM object. You should call this method whenever you make a copy of an interface pointer. uint AddRef() Returns uint The method returns the new reference count. This value is intended to be used only for test purposes. Remarks A COM object uses a per-interface reference-counting mechanism to ensure that the object doesn't outlive references to it. You use AddRef() to stabilize a copy of an interface pointer. It can also be called when the life of a cloned pointer must extend beyond the lifetime of the original pointer. The cloned pointer must be released by calling Release() on it. The internal reference counter that AddRef maintains should be a 32-bit unsigned integer. Notes to callers Call this method for every new copy of an interface pointer that you make. For example, if you return a copy of a pointer from a method, then you must call AddRef() on that pointer. You must also call AddRef() on a pointer before passing it as an in-out parameter to a method; the method will call Release() before copying the out-value on top of it. QueryInterface(ref Guid, out nint) Queries a COM object for a pointer to one of its interface; identifying the interface by a reference to its interface identifier (IID). If the COM object implements the interface, then it returns a pointer to that interface after calling AddRef() on it. HRESULT QueryInterface(ref Guid riid, out nint ppvObject) Parameters riid Guid A reference to the interface identifier (IID) of the interface being queried for. ppvObject nint The address of a pointer to an interface with the IID specified in the riid parameter. Because you pass the address of an interface pointer, the method can overwrite that address with the pointer to the interface being queried for. Upon successful return, *ppvObject (the dereferenced address) contains a pointer to the requested interface. If the object doesn't support the interface, the method sets *ppvObject (the dereferenced address) to nullptr. Returns HRESULT This method returns S_OK if the interface is supported, and E_NOINTERFACE otherwise. If ppvObject (the address) is nullptr, then this method returns E_POINTER. Remarks For any given COM object (also known as a COM component), a specific query for the IUnknown interface on any of the object's interfaces must always return the same pointer value. This enables a client to determine whether two pointers point to the same component by calling QueryInterface(ref Guid, out nint) with IID_IUnknown and comparing the results. It is specifically not the case that queries for interfaces other than IUnknown (even the same interface through the same pointer) must return the same pointer value. There are four requirements for implementations of QueryInterface(ref Guid, out nint) (in these cases, \"must succeed\" means \"must succeed barring catastrophic failure.\"). The set of interfaces accessible on an object through QueryInterface(ref Guid, out nint) must be static, not dynamic. This means that if a call to QueryInterface(ref Guid, out nint) for a pointer to a specified interface succeeds the first time, then it must succeed again. If the call fails the first time, then it must fail on all subsequent calls. It must be reflexive — if a client holds a pointer to an interface on an object, and the client queries for that interface, then the call must succeed. It must be symmetric—if a client holding a pointer to one interface queries successfully for another, then a query through the obtained pointer for the first interface must succeed. It must be transitive — if a client holding a pointer to one interface queries successfully for a second, and through that pointer queries successfully for a third interface, then a query for the first interface through the pointer for the third interface must succeed. Notes to implementers Implementations of QueryInterface(ref Guid, out nint) must never check ACLs. The main reason for this rule is that COM requires that an object supporting a particular interface always return success when queried for that interface. Another reason is that checking ACLs on QueryInterface(ref Guid, out nint) does not provide any real security because any client who has access to a particular interface can hand it directly to another client without any calls back to the server. Also, because COM caches interface pointers, it does not call QueryInterface(ref Guid, out nint) on the server every time a client does a query. Release() Decrements the reference count for an interface on a COM object. uint Release() Returns uint The method returns the new reference count. This value is intended to be used only for test purposes. Remarks When the reference count on an object reaches zero, Release() must cause the interface pointer to free itself. When the released pointer is the only (formerly) outstanding reference to an object (whether the object supports single or multiple interfaces), the implementation must free the object. Note that aggregation of objects restricts the ability to recover interface pointers. Notes to callers Call this method when you no longer need to use an interface pointer. If you are writing a method that takes an in-out parameter, call Release() on the pointer you are passing in before copying the out-value on top of it."

To use this function, call the GetFileInfoEx(string, WindowsFileAttributes, SHGetFileInfoFlags, ref SHFILEINFO) wrapper instead. [Flags] public enum Shell32.SHGetFileInfoFlags Extension Methods EnumExtensions.GetValues(Enum) Fields SHGFI_ADDOVERLAYS = 32 Version 5.0. Apply the appropriate overlays to the file's icon. The SHGFI_ICON flag must also be set. SHGFI_ATTRIBUTES = 2048 Retrieve the item attributes. The attributes are copied to the dwAttributes member of the structure specified in the psfi parameter. These are the same attributes that are obtained from IShellFolder::GetAttributesOf. SHGFI_ATTR_SPECIFIED = 131072 Modify SHGFI_ATTRIBUTES to indicate that the dwAttributes member of the SHFILEINFO structure at psfi contains the specific attributes that are desired. These attributes are passed to IShellFolder::GetAttributesOf. If this flag is not specified, 0xFFFFFFFF is passed to IShellFolder::GetAttributesOf, requesting all attributes. This flag cannot be specified with the SHGFI_ICON flag. SHGFI_DISPLAYNAME = 512 Retrieve the display name for the file, which is the name as it appears in Windows Explorer. The name is copied to the szDisplayName member of the structure specified in psfi. The returned display name uses the long file name, if there is one, rather than the 8.3 form of the file name. Note that the display name can be affected by settings such as whether extensions are shown. SHGFI_EXETYPE = 8192 Retrieve the type of the executable file if pszPath identifies an executable file. The information is packed into the return value. This flag cannot be specified with any other flags. SHGFI_ICON = 256 Retrieve the handle to the icon that represents the file and the index of the icon within the system image list. The handle is copied to the hIcon member of the structure specified by psfi, and the index is copied to the iIcon member. SHGFI_ICONLOCATION = 4096 Retrieve the name of the file that contains the icon representing the file specified by pszPath, as returned by the IExtractIcon::GetIconLocation method of the file's icon handler. Also retrieve the icon index within that file. The name of the file containing the icon is copied to the szDisplayName member of the structure specified by psfi. The icon's index is copied to that structure's iIcon member. SHGFI_LARGEICON = 0 Modify SHGFI_ICON, causing the function to retrieve the file's large icon. The SHGFI_ICON flag must also be set. SHGFI_LINKOVERLAY = 32768 Modify SHGFI_ICON, causing the function to add the link overlay to the file's icon. The SHGFI_ICON flag must also be set. SHGFI_OPENICON = 2 Modify SHGFI_ICON, causing the function to retrieve the file's open icon. Also used to modify SHGFI_SYSICONINDEX, causing the function to return the handle to the system image list that contains the file's small open icon. A container object displays an open icon to indicate that the container is open. The SHGFI_ICON and/or SHGFI_SYSICONINDEX flag must also be set. SHGFI_OVERLAYINDEX = 64 Version 5.0. Return the index of the overlay icon. The value of the overlay index is returned in the upper eight bits of the iIcon member of the structure specified by psfi. This flag requires that the SHGFI_ICON be set as well. SHGFI_PIDL = 8 Indicate that pszPath is the address of an ITEMIDLIST structure rather than a path name. SHGFI_SELECTED = 65536 Modify SHGFI_ICON, causing the function to blend the file's icon with the system highlight color. The SHGFI_ICON flag must also be set. SHGFI_SHELLICONSIZE = 4 Modify SHGFI_ICON, causing the function to retrieve a Shell-sized icon. If this flag is not specified the function sizes the icon according to the system metric values. The SHGFI_ICON flag must also be set. SHGFI_SMALLICON = 1 Modify SHGFI_ICON, causing the function to retrieve the file's small icon. Also used to modify SHGFI_SYSICONINDEX, causing the function to return the handle to the system image list that contains small icon images. The SHGFI_ICON and/or SHGFI_SYSICONINDEX flag must also be set. SHGFI_SYSICONINDEX = 16384 Retrieve the index of a system image list icon. If successful, the index is copied to the iIcon member of psfi. The return value is a handle to the system image list. Only those images whose indices are successfully copied to iIcon are valid. Attempting to access other images in the system image list will result in undefined behavior. SHGFI_TYPENAME = 1024 Retrieve the string that describes the file's type. The string is copied to the szTypeName member of the structure specified in psfi. SHGFI_USEFILEATTRIBUTES = 16 Indicates that the function should not attempt to access the file specified by pszPath. Rather, it should act as if the file specified by pszPath exists with the file attributes passed in dwFileAttributes. This flag cannot be combined with the SHGFI_ATTRIBUTES, SHGFI_EXETYPE, or SHGFI_PIDL flags."

Remarks It is only necessary to call DestroyIcon(nint) for icons and cursors created with the following functions: CreateIconFromResourceEx (if called without the LR_SHARED flag), CreateIconIndirect, and CopyIcon. Do not use this function to destroy a shared icon. A shared icon is valid as long as the module from which it was loaded remains in memory. The following functions obtain a shared icon: LoadIcon LoadImage (if you use the LR_SHARED flag) CopyImage (if you use the LR_COPYRETURNORG flag and the hImage parameter is a shared icon) CreateIconFromResource CreateIconFromResourceEx (if you use the LR_SHARED flag) GetFileInfo(string) Retrieves information about an object in the file system, such as a file, folder, directory, or drive root. public static WindowsFile? GetFileInfo(string path) Parameters path string A string of maximum length MAX_PATH that contains the path and file name. Both absolute and relative paths are valid. This string can use either short (the 8.3 form) or long file names. Returns WindowsFile The WindowsFile instance containing the data about the file if successful; otherwise, null. GetFileInfoEx(string, WindowsFileAttributes, SHGetFileInfoFlags, ref SHFILEINFO) Retrieves information about an object in the file system, such as a file, folder, directory, or drive root. This function provides all the customization of the Windows API function SHGetFileInfoW(string, uint, ref SHFILEINFO, uint, uint), unlike GetFileInfo(string). public static nuint GetFileInfoEx(string pszPath, WindowsFileAttributes dwFileAttributes, Shell32.SHGetFileInfoFlags uFlags, ref Shell32.SHFILEINFO psfi) Parameters pszPath string A string of maximum length MAX_PATH that contains the path and file name. Both absolute and relative paths are valid. <p>If the <code class=\"paramref\">uFlags</code> parameter includes the <xref href=\"FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.Shell32.SHGetFileInfoFlags.SHGFI_PIDL\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> flag, this parameter must be the address of an ITEMIDLIST(PIDL) structure that contains the list of item identifiers that uniquely identifies the file within the Shell's namespace. The PIDL must be a fully qualified PIDL. Relative PIDLs are not allowed.</p> <p>If the <code class=\"paramref\">uFlags</code> parameter includes the <xref href=\"FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.Shell32.SHGetFileInfoFlags.SHGFI_USEFILEATTRIBUTES\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> flag, this parameter does not have to be a valid file name. The function will proceed as if the file exists with the specified name and with the file attributes passed in the dwFileAttributes parameter. This allows you to obtain information about a file type by passing just the extension for pszPath and passing FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL in dwFileAttributes.</p> This string can use either short (the 8.3 form) or long file names. dwFileAttributes WindowsFileAttributes A combination of one or more file attribute flags (WindowsFileAttributes values). If uFlags does not include the SHGFI_USEFILEATTRIBUTES flag, this parameter is ignored, so in that case you should set it to None instead. uFlags Shell32.SHGetFileInfoFlags The flags that specify the file information to retrieve. This should be a combination of Shell32.SHGetFileInfoFlags values. psfi Shell32.SHFILEINFO Pointer to a Shell32.SHFILEINFO structure to receive the file information. Returns nuint A value whose meaning depends on the uFlags parameter. If <code class=\"paramref\">uFlags</code> does not contain <xref href=\"FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.Shell32.SHGetFileInfoFlags.SHGFI_EXETYPE\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> or <xref href=\"FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.Shell32.SHGetFileInfoFlags.SHGFI_SYSICONINDEX\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref>, the return value is non-zero if successful, or zero otherwise. <p>If <code class=\"paramref\">uFlags</code> contains the <xref href=\"FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.Shell32.SHGetFileInfoFlags.SHGFI_EXETYPE\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> flag, the return value specifies the type of the executable file. It will be one of the following values:</p> <table><tbody><tr><td class=\"term\">0</td><td class=\"description\">Nonexecutable file or an error condition.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"term\">LOWORD = NE or PE and HIWORD = Windows version</td><td class=\"description\">Windows application.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"term\">LOWORD = PE and HIWORD = 0</td><td class=\"description\">Console application or .bat file</td></tr></tbody></table> Remarks You should call this function from a background thread. Failure to do so could cause the UI to stop responding. If GetFileInfoEx(string, WindowsFileAttributes, SHGetFileInfoFlags, ref SHFILEINFO) returns an icon handle in the hIcon member of the Shell32.SHFILEINFO structure pointed to by psfi, you are responsible for freeing it with DestroyIcon(nint) when you no longer need it. The WindowsFile wrapper automatically cleans up these resources on dispose, so you should ideally use WindowsFile and convert psfi to a WindowsFile using the WindowsFile(SHFILEINFO, string) constructor. Additionaly, WindowsFile provides managed types for almost all the Shell32.SHFILEINFO properties, so using it is preffered. Note: Once you have a handle to a system image list, you can use the Image List API to manipulate it like any other image list. Because system image lists are created on a per-process basis, you should treat them as read-only objects. Writing to a system image list may overwrite or delete one of the system images, making it unavailable or incorrect for the remainder of the process. You must initialize Component Object Model (COM) with Initialize(COMInitOptions) prior to calling SHGetFileInfoW(string, uint, ref SHFILEINFO, uint, uint). GetFileInfoEx(string, WindowsFileAttributes, SHGetFileInfoFlags, ref SHFILEINFO) wraps this automatically. When you use the SHGFI_EXETYPE flag with a Windows application, the Windows version of the executable is given in the HIWORD of the return value. This version is returned as a hexadecimal value. For details on equating this value with a specific Windows version, see Using the Windows Headers. ShellAbout(nint, string, string?, Icon?) Displays a ShellAbout dialog box.

SendMessage(nint, uint, bool, bool) Sends the specified message to a window or windows. The SendMessage(nint, uint, nuint, nint) function calls the window procedure for the specified window and does not return until the window procedure has processed the message. To send a message and return immediately, use the SendMessageCallback or SendNotifyMessage function. To post a message to a thread's message queue and return immediately, use the PostMessage or PostThreadMessage function. public static nint SendMessage(nint hWnd, uint uMsg, bool wParam, bool lParam) Parameters hWnd nint A handle to the window whose window procedure will receive the message.

Remarks When a message is blocked by UIPI the last error, retrieved with GetLastPInvokeError(), is set to 5 (access denied). Applications that need to communicate using HWND_BROADCAST should use the RegisterWindowMessage function to obtain a unique message for inter-application communication.

The function also sets a value at the specified offset in the extra window memory. public static nint SetWindowLongPtr(nint hWnd, int nIndex, nint dwNewLong) Parameters hWnd nint A handle to the window and, indirectly, the class to which the window belongs. The SetWindowLongPtr(nint, int, nint) function fails if the process that owns the window specified by the hWnd parameter is at a higher process privilege in the UIPI hierarchy than the process the calling thread resides in. Windows XP/2000: The SetWindowLongPtr(nint, int, nint) function fails if the window specified by the hWnd parameter does not belong to the same process as the calling thread. nIndex int The zero-based offset to the value to be set. Valid values are in the range zero through the number of bytes of extra window memory, minus the size of a LONG_PTR. To set any other value, specify one of the DefaultWindowLongPtrValues. dwNewLong nint The replacement value. Returns nint If the function succeeds, the return value is the previous value of the specified offset. If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call <xref href=\"System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetLastPInvokeError\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref>. If the previous value is zero and the function succeeds, the return value is zero, but the function does not clear the last error information. To determine success or failure, clear the last error information by calling SetLastError with 0, then call <xref href=\"FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.User32.SetWindowLongPtr(System.IntPtr%2cSystem.Int32%2cSystem.IntPtr)\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref>. Function failure will be indicated by a return value of zero and a <xref href=\"System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetLastPInvokeError\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\"></xref> result that is nonzero. Remarks Certain window data is cached, so changes you make using SetWindowLongPtr(nint, int, nint) will not take effect until you call the SetWindowPos function. If you use SetWindowLongPtr(nint, int, nint) with the WndProc index to replace the window procedure, the window procedure must conform to the guidelines specified in the description of the WndProc callback function. If you use SetWindowLongPtr(nint, int, nint) with the MessageResult index to set the return value for a message processed by a dialog box procedure, the dialog box procedure should return true directly afterward. Otherwise, if you call any function that results in your dialog box procedure receiving a window message, the nested window message could overwrite the return value you set by using MessageResult. Calling SetWindowLongPtr(nint, int, nint) with the WndProc index creates a subclass of the window class used to create the window. An application can subclass a system class, but should not subclass a window class created by another process.The SetWindowLongPtr(nint, int, nint) function creates the window subclass by changing the window procedure associated with a particular window class, causing the system to call the new window procedure instead of the previous one. Do not call SetWindowLongPtr(nint, int, nint) with the HWNDParent index to change the parent of a child window. Instead, use the SetParent function. HWNDParent is used to change the owner of a top-level window, not the parent of a child window. A window can have either a parent or an owner, or neither, but never both simultaneously. Calling SetWindowLongPtr(nint, int, nint) to set the style on a progress bar will reset its position."

Applications typically use this attribute to mark files for backup or removal. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE) ArchiveDir = Directory | Archive An archive directory. Applications typically use this attribute to mark directories for backup or removal. This is a composite value. Compressed = 2048 A file or directory that is compressed. For a file, all of the data in the file is compressed. For a directory, compression is the default for newly created files and subdirectories. [Obsolete(\"This value is reserved for system use. Do not use.\")] Device = 64 This value is reserved for system use. Do not use. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE) Directory = 16 The handle that identifies a directory. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY) Encrypted = 16384 A file or directory that is encrypted. For a file, all data streams in the file are encrypted. For a directory, encryption is the default for newly created files and subdirectories. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ENCRYPTED) [Obsolete(\"This value is reserved for system use. Do not use.\")] ExAttrib = 262144 A file or directory with extended attributes. This value is for internal use only. Do not use. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_EA) Hidden = 2 The file or directory is hidden. It is not included in an ordinary directory listing. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN) IntegrityStream = 32768 The directory or user data stream is configured with integrity (only supported on ReFS volumes). It is not included in an ordinary directory listing. The integrity setting persists with the file if it's renamed. If a file is copied the destination file will have integrity set if either the source file or destination directory have integrity set. Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP: This flag is not supported until Windows Server 2012. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_INTEGRITY_STREAM) NoContentIndex = 8192 The file or directory is not to be indexed by the content indexing service. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NOT_CONTENT_INDEXED) NoScrubData = 131072 The user data stream not to be read by the background data integrity scanner (AKA scrubber). When set on a directory it only provides inheritance. This flag is only supported on Storage Spaces and ReFS volumes. It is not included in an ordinary directory listing. Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP: This flag is not supported until Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NO_SCRUB_DATA) None = 128 A file that does not have other attributes set. This attribute is valid only when used alone. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL) Offline = 4096 The data of a file is not available immediately. This attribute indicates that the file data is physically moved to offline storage. This attribute is used by Remote Storage, which is the hierarchical storage management software. Applications should not arbitrarily change this attribute. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_OFFLINE) Pinned = 524288 This attribute indicates user intent that the file or directory should be kept fully present locally even when not being actively accessed. This attribute is for use with hierarchical storage management software. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_PINNED) ReadOnly = 1 A file that is read-only. Applications can read the file, but cannot write to it or delete it. This attribute is not honored on directories. For more information, see You cannot view or change the Read-only or the System attributes of folders in Windows Server 2003, in Windows XP, in Windows Vista or in Windows 7. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY) RecallOnDataAccess = 4194304 When this attribute is set, it means that the file or directory is not fully present locally. For a file that means that not all of its data is on local storage (e.g. it may be sparse with some data still in remote storage). For a directory it means that some of the directory contents are being virtualized from another location. Reading the file / enumerating the directory will be more expensive than normal, e.g. it will cause at least some of the file/directory content to be fetched from a remote store. Only kernel-mode callers can set this bit. File system mini filters below the 180000 – 189999 altitude range (FSFilter HSM Load Order Group) must not issue targeted cached reads or writes to files that have this attribute set. This could lead to cache pollution and potential file corruption. For more information, see Handling placeholders. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS) RecallOnOpen = 262144 This attribute only appears in directory enumeration classes (FILE_DIRECTORY_INFORMATION, FILE_BOTH_DIR_INFORMATION, etc.). When this attribute is set, it means that the file or directory has no physical representation on the local system; the item is virtual. Opening the item will be more expensive than normal, e.g. it will cause at least some of it to be fetched from a remote store. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_OPEN) ReparsePoint = 1024 A file or directory that has an associated reparse point, or a file that is a symbolic link. Sparse = 512 A file that is a sparse file. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SPARSE_FILE) System = 4 A file or directory that the operating system uses as part of, or uses exclusively. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM) SystemFile = Hidden | System A system file. A system file has the Hidden and System attributes. This is a composite value. Temporary = 256 A file that is being used for temporary storage. File systems avoid writing data back to mass storage if sufficient cache memory is available, because typically, an application deletes a temporary file after the handle is closed. In that scenario, the system can entirely avoid writing the data. Otherwise, the data is written after the handle is closed. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY) Unpinned = 1048576 This attribute indicates that the file or directory should not be kept fully present locally except when being actively accessed. This attribute is for use with hierarchical storage management software. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_UNPINNED) [Obsolete(\"This value is reserved for system use. Do not use.\")] Virtual = 65536 This value is reserved for system use. Do not use. (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_VIRTUAL) See Also File Attribute Constants"

Before using COM interfaces, we need to initialize COM: // if you're using v0.11 or earlier the function is named COM.CoInitialize instead // if you're using v0.2 or earlier the enum is named CoInit instead (don't blame me for the compatibility and migration issues; that's what you get for using a library in beta) HRESULT hr = COM.Initialize(COMInitOptions.ApartmentThreaded); // or MultiThreaded if inside a non-GUI/non-STA app Now, after initializng COM, we need to check if the initialization succeeded: if (Macros.Succeeded(hr)) { // init succeeded: proceeded with COM // our COM code... } Creating and Interacting with a COM instance Now that COM is initialized, we need to actually create the COM instance, and once again check for success: hr = COM.CreateInstance<IFileOpenDialog>( new Guid(\"DC1C5A9C-E88A-4dde-A5A1-60F82A20AEF7\"), null, COM.CreateInstanceContext.InprocServer, new Guid(\"d57c7288-d4ad-4768-be02-9d969532d960\"), out IFileOpenDialog dlg); if (Macros.Succeeded(hr)) { // creation succeeded: proceed with interaction } And we can now proceed with interacting with the interface, which is a lot easier. In the following example, we configure the file dialog with a custom title and 2 filters: Note This code defines the COMDLG_FILTERSPEC struct itself, because WinInteropUtils doesn't support it yet. [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential, CharSet = CharSet.Unicode)] public struct COMDLG_FILTERSPEC { public string pszName; public string pszSpec; } COMDLG_FILTERSPEC[] filters = new COMDLG_FILTERSPEC[] { new COMDLG_FILTERSPEC { pszName = \"Text Files\", pszSpec = \"*.txt\" }, new COMDLG_FILTERSPEC { pszName = \"All Files\", pszSpec = \"*.*\" } }; // Allocate unmanaged memory (SetFileTypes requires pointer) IntPtr ptr = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(Marshal.SizeOf<COMDLG_FILTERSPEC>() * filters.Length); try { // Copy each struct into unmanaged memory for (int i = 0; i < filters.Length; i++) { IntPtr structPtr = IntPtr.Add(ptr, i * Marshal.SizeOf<COMDLG_FILTERSPEC>()); Marshal.StructureToPtr(filters[i], structPtr, false); } // ptr now points to the unmanaged array dlg.SetFileTypes((uint)filters.Length, ptr); } finally { Marshal.FreeHGlobal(ptr); } dlg.SetTitle(\"Cool File Dialog\"); And now we can actually SHOW the file dialog and read its results: hr = dlg.Show(hWnd); if (Macros.Succeeded(hr)) { Console.WriteLine(\"Dialog accepted!\"); hr = dlg.GetResult(out nint iptr); if (Macros.Succeeded(hr)) { IShellItem item = (IShellItem)Marshal.GetTypedObjectForIUnknown(iptr, typeof(IShellItem)); hr = item.GetDisplayName( SIGDN.SIGDN_FILESYSPATH, out nint pptr); if (Macros.Succeeded(hr)) { string path = Marshal.PtrToStringUni(pptr); Console.WriteLine(\"Chosen path: \" + path); Marshal.FreeCoTaskMem(pptr); } } } Cleanup Once you're done using COM, you need to deinitialize the COM library (if the initialization succeeded) and release any COM interfaces, using the Release method: dlg.Release(); COM.Uninitialize(); Final Example So now, our final example code looks like this: using FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.ComponentObjectModel; using FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.ComponentObjectModel.Interfaces; using FireBlade.WinInteropUtils; [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential, CharSet = CharSet.Unicode)] public struct COMDLG_FILTERSPEC { public string pszName; public string pszSpec; } HRESULT hr = COM.Initialize(COMInitOptions.ApartmentThreaded); if (Macros.Succeeded(hr)) { hr = COM.CreateInstance<IFileOpenDialog>( new Guid(\"DC1C5A9C-E88A-4dde-A5A1-60F82A20AEF7\"), null, COM.CreateInstanceContext.InprocServer, new Guid(\"d57c7288-d4ad-4768-be02-9d969532d960\"), out IFileOpenDialog dlg); if (Macros.Succeeded(hr)) { COMDLG_FILTERSPEC[] filters = new COMDLG_FILTERSPEC[] { new COMDLG_FILTERSPEC { pszName = \"Text Files\", pszSpec = \"*.txt\" }, new COMDLG_FILTERSPEC { pszName = \"All Files\", pszSpec = \"*.*\" } }; // Allocate unmanaged memory (SetFileTypes requires pointer) IntPtr ptr = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(Marshal.SizeOf<COMDLG_FILTERSPEC>() * filters.Length); try { // Copy each struct into unmanaged memory for (int i = 0; i < filters.Length; i++) { IntPtr structPtr = IntPtr.Add(ptr, i * Marshal.SizeOf<COMDLG_FILTERSPEC>()); Marshal.StructureToPtr(filters[i], structPtr, false); } // ptr now points to the unmanaged array dlg.SetFileTypes((uint)filters.Length, ptr); } finally { Marshal.FreeHGlobal(ptr); } dlg.SetTitle(\"Cool File Dialog\"); hr = dlg.Show(hWnd); if (Macros.Succeeded(hr)) { Console.WriteLine(\"Dialog accepted!\"); hr = dlg.GetResult(out nint iptr); if (Macros.Succeeded(hr)) { IShellItem item = (IShellItem)Marshal.GetTypedObjectForIUnknown(iptr, typeof(IShellItem)); hr = item.GetDisplayName( SIGDN.SIGDN_FILESYSPATH, out nint pptr); if (Macros.Succeeded(hr)) { string path = Marshal.PtrToStringUni(pptr); Console.WriteLine(\"Chosen path: \" + path); Marshal.FreeCoTaskMem(pptr); } item.Release(); } } dlg.Release(); } COM.Uninitialize(); } If we run this sample code, a file dialog should appear and, after picking a file, its path should be outputted."
