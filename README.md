# WinInteropUtils
WinInteropUtils is an old, unfinished C# library that provides managed wrappers for unmanaged WinAPI functions. Remember that this library is unfinished, so bugs may occur and features may be missing. I don't know if I'll ever finish this library, but I'm publishing it here for now.<br><br>

All classes are in the namespace `FireBlade.WinInteropUtils`.
