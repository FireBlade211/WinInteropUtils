# WinInteropUtils
WinInteropUtils is an old, unfinished C# library that provides managed wrappers for unmanaged WinAPI functions. Remember that this library is unfinished, so bugs may occur and features may be missing. I don't know if I'll ever finish this library, but I'm publishing it here for now.<br><br>

The base namespace  is `FireBlade.WinInteropUtils`.

## How to install (for now)
Because WinInteropUtils isn't a NuGet package yet, to use it, simply download the DLL file, and go into the add references dialog, select Browse, and open the DLL. Warning: WinInteropUtils is built on .NET 8, so it won't work for .NET Framework projects.
